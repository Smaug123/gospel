# The Gospel according to Patrick

This repo is where I'm actively trying to optimise the behaviour of coding agents.

Epistemic status: it's all vibes.
It remains to be seen whether any of these documents actually work to move agents into the basin I want.

* [gospel.md](./gospel.md): overarching principles, covering the design and writing of software. Originally drafted by Claude Opus 4.5.
* The `skills` folder, which uses Claude's [Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) format to define some standard ways I want to do things.
